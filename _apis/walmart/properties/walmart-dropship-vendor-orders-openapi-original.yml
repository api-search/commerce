      summary: Ship one or more purchase order lines
      description: "<p style=\"color:red; font-size:larger\">POST <walmartAuthServerUrl>/v3/orders/{purchaseOrderId}/shipping</p>\n\nThis
        request allows consumers to ship one or more purchase order (PO) lines. \n\nFor
        Site to Store (S2S) orders, package and pallet advance ship notices (ASN)
        need to be included in the request payload.\n\nChanging the status of order
        lines to `Shipped` triggers a charge to the customer. \nIn order to avoid
        underselling, orders must be acknowledged before sending a shipping update.
        \nOnce an order line is marked as shipped, it cannot be updated.\n\nNote:
        `shipDateTime` must be in UTC.\n\nThe response to a successful call contains
        the order with the shipped line item.\n"

          This parameter identifies each facility from which the inventory is requested. The identifier is autogenerated during drop ship vendor (DSV) account creation. Every time users add or update a facility in Supplier Center, a new identifier is generated. Ensure this value is up to date.

        response to a successful call contains the acknowledged order. \nAs a good
        practice, acknowledge orders to avoid underselling.\n\nOnly those orders that
        are in a `Created` state should be acknowledged. \nOrders that are in an `Acknowledged`
        state can be re-acknowledged. \nThis is desirable, for example, when resolving
        an error response from a previous API call. \nOrders with line items that
